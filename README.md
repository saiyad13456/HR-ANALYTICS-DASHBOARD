2. Handled missing and inconsistent data entries, ensuring clean, accurate, and structured datasets were ready for modeling and visualization.
3. Performed data transformation and data type correction in Power BI Power Query Editor, optimizing the dataset for better performance and analysis.
4. Created conditional columns in Power BI (example: setting Attrition Status, Age Bands) to enrich the dataset for advanced segmentation and grouping.
5. Applied DAX functions (Data Analysis Expressions) such as SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, DIVIDE to create aggregated measures like Attrition Rate, Satisfaction Average, and Employee Counts.
6. Built custom KPI cards in Power BI to dynamically display metrics like Overall Employees (1470), Total Attrition (237), and Attrition Rate (16.12%).
7. Developed interactive dashboards using a combination of bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and matrix tables to make HR insights easily accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

13. Applied advanced aggregation logic to differentiate attrition trends across Under 25, Under 30-35, 35-44, 45-54, and Over 55 age brackets, enhancing strategic decision-making.
14. Used conditional formatting in Power BI tables (Job Satisfaction Rating) to make high-risk areas (low satisfaction) visually stand out for quick action by HR leaders.
